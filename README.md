#Introduction to My Data Journey
My journey into the field of data analysis began during my high school years when I developed a curiosity about uncovering the connections between data contained in financial reports and stock prices over time. This initial interest spurred me to further explore data through various courses during my university education.

To formally enhance my knowledge and skills, I enrolled in the Data Analytics and Business Intelligence Program at Dataleum Academy. This program provided a structured and comprehensive education in data analysis, equipping me with the necessary tools and techniques to excel in this field.

Here in my portfolio, you will find projects that reflect my learning and practical applications from this educational journey.
